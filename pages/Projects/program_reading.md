## Reading a Program

The WLCB printed programs for every one of their weekly meetings, which provide a succinct key to the planned events. This exhibit created by Clara Love takes you through a program from one of the WLCBâ€™s Twelfth Night festival celebrating the Epiphany, which occurred twelve days after Christmas on the liturgical calendar. This event was a highlight of the Club year and was open to the public. For many years, a stuffed peacock--the Club mascot--was included in the procession of dishes served at the event. Musical entertainment, poetry and prose recitations, and sometimes dramatic performances were part of the festivities. Scroll through the program to experience the sights and sounds of Twelfth Night for yourself.
