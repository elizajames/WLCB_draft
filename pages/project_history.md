## About the Archive
The Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore was founded in 1890 by a group of educated women who wanted to get their words into print. Over the next thirty years, they met every Tuesday afternoon between October and June, hearing lectures on various topics, appreciating each other's written contributions, enjoying refreshments and each other's company.

This site is a digital repository of the papers of the Club, which were meticulously kept over the years by its members. A team of undergraduate students led by Professor Jean Lee Cole, Department of English at Loyola University Maryland, has engaged in the transcription and interpretation of documents relating to the Club and its members. An anthology of writings by Club members, *[Parole Femine: Words and Lives of the Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore](https://www.amazon.com/Parole-Femine-Womans-Literary-Baltimore/dp/1627202528/)*, was published by Loyola's Apprentice House Press in 2019, and additional research is linked on this site under the Explore tab.
