## Minutes of Club Meetings

At every meeting, the Recording Secretary took notes of the proceedings, which she then copied later into the official minutes books. On occasion, other officers or Club members took notes or transcribed the minutes on the Secretary if she was absent from a meeting or otherwise unable to perform her duties. The records of meeting minutes are remarkably complete, attesting to their importance to the Club.

Minutes are organized by seasons, which began in October and ended in May or early June.Salons were held roughly monthly and often included musical performances as well as readings of poetry and essays, and addresses to the Club from Club officers and notable guests. Board of Managers meetings were held bi-weekly or monthly, depending on the needs of the Club. In these meetings, Club officers made organizational decisions regarding finances, membership, governance, and other procedural matters. The meeting type is indicated within each transcribed document.
