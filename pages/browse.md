The Woman's Literary Club of Baltmore produced thousands--and thousands-- of pages of writings. In their weekly meetings, they shared essays, poetry, fiction, translations, and tributes to writers from the Club, from Baltimore, from Maryland, and from around the world.

All of this activity was geared for the crowning glory of publication in print, and an astounding number of them were successful. They published novels, short stories, and poetry in volumes from the nation's most respected presses and in popular magazines and daily newspapers (where some worked as reporters and editors). Their plays were performed locally and on Broadway. Still others wrote histories, philosophical and religious tracts, and literary criticism.
