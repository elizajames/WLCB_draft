## Club Records

Well aware of their historic precedence, the Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore kept meticulous records, especially during the first twenty-five years of its existence. The papers of the Club, held at the Maryland Center for History and Culture in Baltimore, Maryland, include membership logs and dues books, over 3,000 pages of handwritten (and later typed) meeting minutes, printed programs, printed and manuscript versions of the Club constitution, scrapbooks, correspondence, and other materials relating to the Club. Many of these documents have been transcribed or otherwise transformed into digitally searchable documents on this archival website.

### [Meeting Minutes](https://elizajames.github.io/WLCB_draft/meeting_minutes.html)

The Maryland Center for History and Culture holds complete minutes for meetings between 1890 and 1920, and rough transcriptions of the vast majority have been uploaded to this site. Notes for additional seasons are in the process of being transcribed and all are being annotated to provide historical and situational context for the benefit of students and researchers. 

Minutes of Club meetings are organized by season. Notes were taken at each meeting and then copied later into the minutes books by the Recording Secretary. On occasion, other officers or Club members took notes or transcribed the minutes on the Secretary if she was absent from a meeting or otherwise unable to perform her duties. The records of meeting minutes are remarkably complete, attesting to their importance to the Club. 

Each season began in October and ended in May or early June. Salons were held roughly monthly and often included musical performances as well as readings of poetry and essays, and addresses to the Club from Club officers and notable guests. Board of Managers meetings were held bi-weekly or monthly, depending on the needs of the Club. In these meetings, Club officers made organizational decisions regarding finances, membership, governance, and other procedural matters. The meeting type is indicated within each transcribed document.

### [Programs](https://elizajames.github.io/WLCB_draft/programs.html)

The WLCB had programs printed for each of their weekly meetings. Each one lists the date, order of events, titles of works shared, who created those works, who presented them to the Club, and which committee was in charge of organizing the meeting. Some of these programs have information that cannot be found in the minutes for a given meeting; for instance, the meeting minutes might describe a Club member reading a piece but neglect to include the exact title, which is listed on that meeting's program. All of this valuable information from the programs can be explored via this website's Advanced Search page, which accesses a database of meeting agenda items compiled through transcription of these programs.

The significance of the programs goes beyond the raw data they contain, however. The materiality of these documents is also something special to behold: each one is printed in the Club's signature purple, with the WLCB crest at the top. The artful designs of the programs shifted over the course of many years, and some more elaborate Club events demanded more elaborate programs. This Programs exhibit [need link](link) highlights what these documents actually looked like, and in the process provides an in-depth look at what it would be like to follow along with a Club meeting.

### [Constitutions](https://elizajames.github.io/WLCB_draft/constitution.html)

One of the first tasks the WLCB laid out for itself was creating a constitution and a set of by-laws. The Club revisited this document at different points over the years, and issued new versions in the form of printed pamphlets and manuscript copies preserved in large, leather-bound volumes held at the Maryland Center for History and Culture. This site includes transcriptions of Constitutions from 1890, 1894, and 1902. 

### [Membership Lists](https://elizajames.github.io/WLCB_draft/membership.html)

Club membership was documented in varying forms over the Club's existence. Extant in the MCHC collection are dues books for the Club's early years, as well as "roll call" lists taken at the May business meetinsg and occasionally at other times during the season. The Club also documented the nomination, election, and induction of new members and member resignations in the Club minutes. These dispersed data are being consolidated into a single spreadsheet, available in provisional form here.

All materials included here are held at the Maryland Center for History and Culture and are reproduced here with permission. Those seeking to consult the original documents should contact MCHC. These materials were transcribed with the support of an Aperio Series of Humane Texts grant from the Center for the Humanities at Loyola University Maryland.
