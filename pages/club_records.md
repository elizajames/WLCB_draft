## Club Records

### Meeting Minutes

The Woman's Literature Club of Baltimore papers at the Maryland Historical Society include over 3,000 pages of minutes of Club meetings recorded between 1890 and 1920. Although the Club continued to exist through the 1930s, minutes for the 1920-1941 period are no longer extant.

Minutes of Club meetings are organized by season and grouped by decades in the links to the right. Minutes were taken by the Recording Secretary, who customarily entered into the Club minutes book. On occasion, however, other officers or Club members transcribed the minutes into the Club minutes book based on the notes of the Recording Secretary or her appointed substitute. 

Each season began in October and ended in May or early June. Salons were held roughly monthly and often included musical performances as well as readings of poetry and essays, and addresses to the Club from Club officers and notable guests.

Board of Managers meetings were held bi-weekly or monthly, depending on the needs of the Club and the inclination of Club officers; minutes of these meetings are included here also. They show the Club's officers making organizational decisions, working out disagreements, and discussing the identity and future direction of the Club. Minutes of these meetings were sometimes included in the regular Club minutes notebook, but for many years were kept in a separate notebook. Each file indicates whether the minutes pertain to Club meetings generally or to Board of Managers meetings only.

All materials included here are held at the Maryland Historical Society and are reproduced here with permission. Those seeking to consult the original documents should contact MDHS.

The notebooks containing the minutes were transcribed by members of the 2017-2018 Aperio team, Professor Jean Lee Cole, Cynthia Requardt, and members of the Friends School class of 2018. These materials were transcribed with the support of an Aperio Series of Humane Texts grant from the Center for the Humanities at Loyola University Maryland.

### Programs

For each of their weekly meetings, the Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore had a program printed. These programs give a concise overview of what happened at each meeting. Each one lists the date, order of events, titles of works shared, who created those works, who presented them to the Club, and which committee was in charge of organizing the meeting. Some of these programs have information that cannot be found in the minutes for a given meeting; for instance, the meeting minutes might describe a Club member reading a piece but neglect to include the exact title, which is listed on that meeting's program. All of this valuable information from the programs can be explored via this website's Advanced Search page, which accesses a database of meeting agenda items compiled through transcription of these programs.

The significance of the programs goes beyond the raw data they contain, however. The materiality of these documents is also something special to behold: each one is printed in the Club's signature purple, with the WLCB crest at the top. The artful designs of the programs shifted over the course of many years, and some more elaborate Club events demanded more elaborate programs. This Programs exhibit highlights what these documents actually looked like, and in the process provides an in-depth look at what it would be like to follow along with a Club meeting.
