# Projects

The purpose of this archival site is to make further research possible. By transcribing manuscript documents to make them searchable, organizing geographical and biographical data, and making everything publicly accessible, the Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore Archive is just a starting point for research on women in Baltimore, female authorship, and turn of the century American literary history. This page collects research projects completed by project team members.

## Where They Lived

Based on dues records and membership notebooks, this [map created by Clara Love](https://elizajames.github.io/WLCB_draft/mapping.html) shows the flourishing of Baltimore literary culture in the area northwest of the city center at the turn of the century, as well as growing networks of female authorship developed over the course of the Club's first three decades in existence. <br>

### Katherine Pearson Woods

(Exhibit under development, to include biographical information, an e-edition of Woods's first novel, _Metzerott, Shoemaker_ (1889), and information about Christian Socialism and labor reform movements of the late-nineteenth century.) <p>

### Reading a Program

The WLCB printed programs for every one of their weekly meetings, which provide a succinct key to the planned events--if you know how to read them. This [exhibit created by Clara Love](https://elizajames.github.io/WLCB_draft/reading-a-program.html) takes you through a program from one of their most notable annual traditions--the WLCB's Twelfth Night Celebration, held each year to celebrate the Epiphany-- to provide a snapshot of what a meeting may have looked and sounded like.
