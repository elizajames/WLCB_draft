## Projects

The purpose of this archival site is to make further research possible. By transcribing manuscript documents to make them searchable, organizing geographical and biographical data, and making everything publicly accessible, the Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore Archive is just a starting point for research on women in Baltimore, female authorship, and turn of the century American literary history. This page collects research projects completed by project team members.

### Where They Lived
Based on dues records and membership notebooks, this [map created by Clara Love](https://elizajames.github.io/WLCB_draft/mapping.html) shows the flourishing of Baltimore literary culture in the area northwest of the city center at the turn of the century, as well as growing networks of female authorship developed over the course of the Club's first three decades in existence.

### Reading a Program
The WLCB printed programs for every one of their weekly meetings, which provide a succinct key to the planned events--if you know how to read them. This [exhibit created by Clara Love](https://elizajames.github.io/WLCB_draft/reading-a-program.html) takes you through one representative program to provide a snapshot of what a meeting may have looked--and sounded--like.
