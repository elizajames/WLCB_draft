### Board Meeting--January 20th 1891

#### Board of Management 861 Garden St.; Reception to Miss Dorsey; decoration committee; Constitution: Article on Literary Committee; On residents of Baltimore; Non-resident guests.

A meeting of the Board of Management of W.L.C. was held at 861 Garden Street, on Tuesday, January 20th. Reception to be offered to Miss H.C. [Hester Crawford] Dorsey (Mrs. Albert L. Richardson) was agreed upon, and a decoration committee suggested.

Subject of the Constitution brought forward and the article on Literary Committee (Section I of Art[icle] 3.) was discussed. It was suggested that it may be used at least as a standing committee to decide literary points. It was decided for the present to leave it in the body of the Constitution, and if necessary, to add a defining clause as a By-Law.

Decided that residents of Baltimore may only be brought to the Club as visitors very occasionally. Any member may bring a non-resident guest.

Eliza Ridgely
Secretary
