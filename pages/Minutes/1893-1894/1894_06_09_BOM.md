The First vice President, Mrs. Bullock,[^bullock] called the meeting to order, and announced that the business before us was the appointment of a House Committee, to superintend the necessary arrangements regarding our rooms and furniture for the summer season.

[^bullock]: As indicated in the previous paragraph, Bullock was in fact the Treasurer of the Club at this time, not the First Vice President.
