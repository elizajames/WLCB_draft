#### 10th Salon 12 E. Centre St. October 6th

The tenth Salon of the Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, and first of the autumn of 1891 was held at 12 East Centre Street, in the rooms of the Academy of Sciences, on Tuesday afternoon, October 6th, after 3.30 o’clock.

The President was in the chair, and there were about thirty one (31) persons present.

#### President’s greeting; Letter accepting room and reply; Resolution of thanks to Academy of Science

The President, in her greeting to the Club, bade the members welcome to the new room offered them by the Academy of Sciences with the suggestion that the members become associates of the Academy, thus proving that we are “regarded as an earnest body of workers[.]” A copy of the letter of acceptance written by the President of the Woman’s Literary Club to Dr Uhler[,] President of the Academy of Sciences, and Dr Uhler’s reply were read by the Secretary. The Club thanked the Academy of Sciences by a rising vote, and a resolution of thanks was framed by Mrs. [Annie Leakin] Sioussat and passed by the Club.

#### B. Taylor’s portrait; Cabinet for President; Milnor elected to the Maryland Historical Society; Various Club books and their uses

The President referred to various matters of interest as follows: The portrait of Bayard Taylor given by Mrs. [Elizabeth Turner] Graham; the artist’s proof engraving and etching lent by Mrs. Graham; the ornamentation of the room--inviting the ladies to make presents to the Club, also gifts of needlework and their own literary labors; the cabinet given by the President--suggesting that it might be used for a collection of autographs of Club members; the election of Miss Mary Worthington Milnor as the first lady member of the Maryland Historical Society; the fair promise of the Club papers presented; the various Club books--1. “Authors and Artists of Maryland,” in charge of Miss [Mary Worthington] Milnor, 2. Scrap book for clippings by

Miss [Mary Worthington] Milnor who would be glad to have the assistance of Club members in collecting anecdotes of celebrated men, etc.,[^n10-06_01] and who could furnish a very good form of indexing for the books, 3. “Waifs” by Miss [Virginia Woodward] Cloud for printed matter of interest to members, not collected in book form, 4. and 5. “Club Records”--2 volumes--of which “Scrap book” by Miss [Louisa Courtland Osburne] Haughton of printed accounts of Club meetings, etc., and “Blank book” by Miss [Grace] Balch to contain accounts of any special meeting and papers members would care to have, 6. “Woman’s Work and Progress” by Mrs. [Caroline S.] Eames, of which the central idea in so full a subject might be to collect work that bears a literary stamp.

[^n10-06_01]: This odd use of the generalized “men” underscores the deep entrenchment of masculinist language conventions at this time.

#### “Public Schools” committee; O.T. Miller’s book; Reese’s and Easter’s books to appear

The President also called attention to the “Public Schools” Committee formed by request of the Supervisor of Public Schools, and consisting of Mrs. [Mary Noyes] Colvin, Miss Bond, Miss Sally [K.] Carter, Miss [Mary Worthington] Milnor and Miss [Edith] Duer--also announced the gift to the Club by Mrs. Olive Thorne Miller of her last book, the approaching appearance of Miss [Lizette Woodworth] Reese's book dedicated to Sidney Lanier and of Mrs. Easter’s [Marguerite E. Easter] book dedicated to William Hand Browne. [^n10-06_02]
