#### Crane read “Critic”’s article on “Absence of Creative Faculty in Woman.”; Reply read by Szold.; Volunteers asked to uphold 1st view. None--Miss Clark appointed.; Choice of title for discussion; Sioussat uphold affirmative view.

Miss [Lydia] Crane read the article in “The Critic” by Mollie Elliott Sewell [Molly Elliot Seawell]  on “The Absence of the Creative Faculty in Woman.” Miss Se[a]well said that woman--not excepting Sappho, George Eliot and Austen--has created nothing that will live in music, art, literature, or even in mechanical invention, and is made up of emotions; while man possesses intellect.

The reply to this article also taken from “The Critic” was read by Miss [Henrietta] Szold.

The President asked for a volunteer to uphold the view of the first paper at the discussion to take place the last Tuesday in February. So slight was the response that the President decided to place the matter in the hands of Miss Clark [Bessy L. Clark] who had introduced the subject.

The choice of a title for the discussion was put to the vote and decided upon as follows: “Does the creative faculty exist in woman.” Mrs. [Annie Leakin] Sioussat consented to

sustain the affirmative view of the question.

The President announced that the programme for the following week would be in charge of Mrs. [Mary Noyes] Colvin.

Adjourned.

Eliza Ridgely
Secretary.
