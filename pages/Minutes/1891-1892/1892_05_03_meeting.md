### Manly--"Notes on Gilbert Elga's Son"; Jenkins--on "10 Tales" of Maupassant, Brown--on "Two Novels"; Reese--on "Barrie's Novels"

Mrs. [Gaston] Manly read "Notes on Gilbert Elga's Son"--a book written by Mrs. Harriet Davis, the scene of which is laid among the Quakers in Montgomery County, Maryland.

Mrs. [Martha Lee] Jenkins gave "A Review of the Ten Tales" of Guy de Maupassant, citing his axiom that "to prove you have first rate talent you must show first rate style,” contrasting his tale "L'Orage" with the simple story a "Piece of String,” and praising also his "Moonlight,” etc.

Miss Mary Willcox Brown read a criticism of "Two Novels"--"Taras Bulba" by Gogol and "Rois en Exile" by Daudet.

Miss Lizette Woodworth Reese read a paper upon "Barrie's Novels"--so true, simple, lifelike, pathetic, and sometimes humorous--giving words of special admiration to "Thrums.” Miss Reese also told how the story grew from Barrie's homesick feelings for his native weaving village.

### On book for representation at World's Fair; Criticisms on books of light reading suggested--President.

The President announced the programme for the following Tuesday, and also that in consequence of several requests that the Club should be represented

at the World's Fair, it had been decided by the Board that selections should be made of the best Club papers of the last two years, and that these should be sent to the Fair to represent the Club. Suggestions on the subject will be gladly received.

The President also thought that during the summer members might make criticisms upon books of light reading for the Current Criticism Committee.
