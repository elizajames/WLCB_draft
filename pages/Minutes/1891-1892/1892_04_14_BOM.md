It was decided that two maids should be placed in the ladies' dressing room; that badges of white and violet should be provided for the Committee, for Miss [Sarah] Adams who would have charge of the decoration of the hall, and for Mr Edwin Turnbull and a friend who would assist in introducing the guests.

Decided, that bouquets of violets should be sent to the President and Miss [Grace Denio] Litchfield, and that it would be advisable for the Reception Committee to be at the Lyceum as near 7.30 o'clock as possible.

The sum of $275[^value] was voted from the Treasury for the supper, flowers and hall--the supper to be served by a caterer, and to consist of croquettes and peas, salad, ices, bonbons, coffee, etc., and to include china and waiters.
