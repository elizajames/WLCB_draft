The initial meeting of the Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore was held on Wednesday afternoon, March 19th [18]90 at four o’clock in the President’s lecture room of the Woman’s College, the privilege of the room having been kindly extended by Dr. John F. Goucher and Dr. Hopkins president of the college.

There were between thirty and forty ladies present in response to notes of invitation from Miss Hester Crawford Dorsey[^Dorsey] to those interested in organizing a woman’s literary club in Baltimore--

[^Dorsey]: Hester Dorsey Crawford married Albert Richardson in 1891 and was subsequently referred to as Mrs. Richardson throughout the Club meeting minutes.

#### Aims and Objects of Club

The meeting was called to order by Miss Dorsey who stated briefly her object in asking the ladies to assemble there. At her request Mrs. Fabian Franklin [Christine Ladd-Franklin] then explained, in a few well chosen words, the aims and objects of the proposed association which would be to further greater intellectual development among the women of Baltimore and to promote social relations among those of similar tastes.

Miriam Florence Squier (1836-1914) was the editor of _Frank Leslie’s Lady’s Magazine_ and married the magazine’s publisher, Frank Leslie, after which she became widely known as "Mrs. Frank Leslie." After her husband died in 1880, Leslie legally changed her name to Mrs. Frank Leslie and took over her husband’s numerous publications, turning them into immensely profitable concerns. A lavish entertainer and flamboyant celebrity figure, Leslie espoused suffrage and willed her fortune to suffrage activist Carrie Chapman Catt.
