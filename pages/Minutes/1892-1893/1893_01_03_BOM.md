### 1893  
### Board of Management: Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore  
### 1st Meeting of 1893. 
### Board of Management Meeting.[^note]
[^note]: Preceding the first page of Board of Managers meeting minutes, Recording Secretary Lydia Crane included this note: "The Recording Secretary must record by way of Preface that while she has wished to have her reports adopted and approved by the whole Board of Management, the reading of them to the Board has sometimes in the press of business and of time been omitted, and she has simply recorded here the best account of the business transacted that she could make, conscientiously, from notes taken at the meetings of the Board,--on the occasions when they have not been so regularly read and adopted. She may have recorded more than necessary, but it was in the endeavor to do faithful work. Lydia Crane. Recording Secretary for 1893." 

The Board of Management of the Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore met, according to the provision of the Constitution, on the first Tuesday in January--January 3rd, 1893,--for the consideration of the names of those persons proposed as new members in the Club.

The Recording Secretary being absent--on account of death in her family--and no names having been sent to her, and none to any other member of the Board of Management, the business was unavoidably postponed. On motion, the Board then adjourned until January 10th, 1893.
