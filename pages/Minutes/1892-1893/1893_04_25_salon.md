### Report in the Baltimore Sun of April 26th, 1893.

“The Woman’s Literary Club enjoyed yesterday afternoon the usual monthly “Salon,” at which the reading of papers and poems was followed by informal talk and five o’clock tea. A bright and interesting paper on “The Education of French Girls” was read by Mademoiselle [Rosine] Mellé, instructor in French at Bryn Mawr School. Several unpublished letters by Sidney Lanier, written in the poet’s exquisite style, were read by Mrs. Turnbull,—who also read a charming little poem entitled “Twilight’s Hush,—an Etching,” by Mrs. Marguerite E. Easter.—Mrs. John M. Miller read a letter written by Madame Jerome Bonaparte, who was the beautiful Betsy Patterson, to her father while she was in England, and inclosing a piece of a ball gown, which she wore on some special occasion.—“My Lady’s Eyes,” a poem by Miss Anna Vernon Dorsey of Washington was also read.”
