Marguerite E. Easter, born in Virginia in 1840, moved to Baltimore when she was young and considered it her home. Her father was Daniel Miller, a prominent Baltimore merchant. An accomplished poetess and writer, she was a founding member of the Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore. Her first publication was her poem “Clytie” in the Southern Magazine in 1871, which received a laudatory notice in the Baltimore Sun. She went on to publish her collection Clytie and Other Poems, in 1892; her work also appeared in women's club publications. Easter served as the Chairman of the House Committee in 1890. She died in 1894.
