Anne "Annie" Weston Whitney was born in Massachusetts in 1849. She moved to Baltimore and was an extremely active Club member from 1892-1908, holding office as a Vice President and Chairman of many committees during those years. Whitney was also the secretary of the American Folk-Lore Society, and she published multiple collections of Maryland folk beliefs and superstitions. A volume of her writings, compiled with fellow member Caroline Canfield Bullock, was published posthumously in 1925, under the title *Folk-Lore in Maryland*. 

News articles were published about Whitneyâ€™s curiosity for folklore and passion for research, and she remained a prominent Club member, even after her move to New York in 1908, until her death the following year.
