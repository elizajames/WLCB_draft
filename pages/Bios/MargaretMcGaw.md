## Margaret A. (Mrs. George K.) McGaw (1852-1924)

Margaret Ann Worden McGaw was married to George K. McGaw (1850-1919) in 1877. He owned a successful grocery business, was active in the St. Andrew’s Society and served on the boards of the Johns Hopkins Hospital, the Presbyterian Home for Orphans and the Tome Institute. The McGaws had two daughters and lived at 1012 St. Paul Street. 

Margaret McGaw was one of twenty members elected to the Literary Club in May 1894 following the many member resignations over the direction the club was taking.  She served as a member of the Board of Managers from 1900-1902 and was elected again in 1908, serving until she resigned from the Club in 1911. Mrs. McGaw served as second Vice President for three years, 1902-1905, and briefly acted as President in the absence of the President and first Vice President in 1908. Mrs. McGaw was an infrequent presenter of papers and in 1906 gave a humorous account of why domestic concerns prevented her from writing essays for the Club
