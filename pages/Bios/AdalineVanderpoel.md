Adaline Vanderpoel was born in New York in 1830, and married Aaron Vanderpoel. They had a daughter, but in 1863 she tragically passed away at one and a half years old. She moved to Baltimore after her marriage and joined the Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore. Her membership lasted a decade, from 1900-1910, but she was a quiet Club member. She shared articles with the Club a handful of times, but sometimes went whole seasons without presenting. She shared her most popular article, a travel piece titled “Bermuda Past and Present,” multiple times, and eventually had it privately published at a press in New York. After she left the Club in 1910, she moved abroad, and died in London in 1912.
