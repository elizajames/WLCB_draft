## Ellen Austin (Mrs. Jordan) Stabler (1851-1925?)

Marriage to Jordan Stabler brought Ellen Austin Walker Stabler to Baltimore in 1894. This was the second marriage for both. Ellen Walker was born and raised in Massachusetts, the daughter of a Congregational minister, and was married first to Marcellus Stearns, whose work took them to Hot Springs, Arkansas and Atlantic, Iowa before settling in Palatine Bridge, New York, where he died in 1891. Jordan Stabler, who ran a successful grocery firm, was a member of a larger Quaker family from Sandy Spring, Maryland. His brother Edward Stabler, Jr. was the husband of Eliza Butler Stabler, also a WLCB member. The Stablers traveled extensively and filled their home with art and curios, which she enjoyed sharing with friends and Club members. 

Ellen Stabler joined the WLCB in January 1895 and remained a member until her death. She was active in the administration of the club, serving as Recording Secretary in the 1903-04 and 1904-05 seasons. In 1906, Stabler was elected First Vice President and served until 1911, when she resigned for health reasons. For a few months in 1907-08 during the absence of Mrs. Wrenshall, Mrs. Stabler served as Club president.
