## Katharine H. Wrenshall Markland

The daughter of Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore president Letitia Wrenshall and her husband John C. Wrenshall, Katharine Humphreys Wrenshall entered Baltimore society in the early twentieth centuryâ€”in the wake of her mother. She first appears in WLCB records in the 1904-1905 season, and served on the board from 1911-1913. She married Fletcher Garard Markland of California in 1901, but they divorced shortly thereafter in 1905. Club records continued to refer to as "Mrs. Wrenshall Markland," even as she published under her maiden name. She published writing pertaining to travel, art history, and some short fiction. She served as her mother's assistant in her magic lantern tours around Europe, and is described by a 1912 newspaper as an "artist and photographer and expert slide painter."
