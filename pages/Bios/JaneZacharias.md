## Jane Zacharias

Jane Zacharias was born in Frederick, Maryland, one of seven children born to the Rev. Daniel Zacharias. Zacharias, who was fondly known as Miss Jane or Janie, was a young, active member of the Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore during its early years. She was both a writer and an accomplished musician. She often organized musicals as well as played the organ in several area churches. Her only known publication was The Newsboy’s Christmas Party. It was written for her passion and relationship with the local newspaper boys. Many of boys were pupils in her class or attended meetings held by several organizations she assisted in establishing for them such as the Newsboys’ Association and the Newsboys’ Reading Rooms. She was a surrogate mother to many of the boys and they really considered her “something good and wonderful, yet human enough to understand their trails and joys.”
