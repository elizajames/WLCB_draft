Margaret Sutton Briscoe was born in Baltimore in 1864 and was an honorary member of the Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore. She was educated by private tutor, regretting that she never attended college. She wrote prolifically for a variety of publications in New York, including *Harper's Bazaar* and *Harper's Monthly*, but after meeting Arthur Hopkins and marrying him in 1895, the couple moved to Amherst, MA, where he became a chemistry professor at Amherst College. The Hopkins had one daughter, Cornelia Dushane Hopkins. Margaret Sutton Briscoe also taught at Amherst and served as a student counselor, belonged to the Ladies of Amherst Club, the Amherst School Alliance, and the Amherst Civic League. She traveled the world, opposed suffrage, identified as a southern woman, and knew Mark Twain. She was a prolific author of short stories and novels, many of which were published in various magazines published by the Harper and Brothers publishing house and later collected in book form. Briscoe died in 1941.
