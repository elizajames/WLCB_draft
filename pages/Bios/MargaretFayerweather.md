## Margaret Pollock Fayerweather (1845-1930)

Margaret Fayerweather joined the Club in 1903 soon after her arrival in Baltimore.  She was raised in Iowa and lived with her husband Edward E. Fayerweather near Chicago. Their son Rhoades was a doctor in Baltimore, and after her husband’s death in 1902, Margaret lived with her son and his family in Roland Park. Fayerweather did not establish permanent residency in Baltimore, spending some years in Boston, and then wintering in California. When she was in Baltimore, she presented papers on historical topics and assisted in the administration of the Club. She served two terms on the Board of Management, 1913-1915, and several times served on the elections and audit committees.

Fayerweather also was a member of the Garden Club of America. In 1920, they published a letter from her (signed Mrs. E. E. Fayerweather), where she described her family’s practice of using live Christmas trees during the holiday season. She wrote,

*In my family we go to the nursery where Evergreen trees are grown, select one, perhaps three or four feet high, have a box or tub filled with earth, which is easily concealed by moss or green paper. After a few days in the house the children tire of it and we plant it out on the grounds. We have never lost one and each child lays claim to one or more. Sometimes if the weather is fine at Christmas, they go into the yard and decorate the tree with popcorn, paper flowers, bright berries. By so doing, nothing is lost and a fine tree gained.*
