Annie Middleton Leakin Sioussat, born in 1856 in Georgetown, D.C., was a historian, author, and daughter of the Rev. George Armistead Leakin, who served as a chaplain in the U.S. Army and was a well-known Episcopal priest during the early nineteenth century. Sioussat was a historian for the Maryland Society of the Colonial Dames of America, and also served as the president of the Maryland branch of the Women’s Auxiliary of the Protestant Episcopal Church for thirty years. Sioussat's notes from her historical work with the Society of the Colonal Dames of America were published in two volumes, Old Manors in Colonial Maryland (1911) and Old Baltimore (1931). She passed away at the age of 92 in 1942 and is buried in the All Saints Episcopal Church Cemetery in Reisterstown, MD.
