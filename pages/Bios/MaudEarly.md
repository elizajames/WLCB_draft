Maud Graham Early was born in 1842 and was a founding member of the Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore. Her participation in the Club led to her involvement in several other organizations, notably the Folklore Society and the Audubon Society. In 1894 she read “The Ideal Club Woman” before the Federation of Clubs, which met at Philadelphia. She was also the editor of the Home and Children’s Department of the Mount Washington Advocate. Early was a member of the Club's Committee on Archaeology, and in June of 1895 she published “Three Queens of Egypt” in the *Southern Literary Messenger* (of Washington D.C.) She was married to John D. Early, and their daughter, Eveline R. Early, was also a member of the Club. She died in 1905.
