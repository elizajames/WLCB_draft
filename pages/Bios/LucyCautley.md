Lucy Randolph Daniel was born in Richmond, Virginia in 1854. Little is known of her early life. She and her husband, Richard K. Cautley, had three sons; her eldest worked at Cornell University, where Cautley attended summer classes as an adult. Cautley strongly identified as a Southerner, which was evident through her writing and her involvement as an officer for six years for the New York division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. Cautley was a member of the Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore from 1894 to 1910. She was active on the Club’s Board of Management from 1898 to 1900, then co-vice president from 1900-1903. She shared numerous short stories and poems within the Club meetings. However, only few of her works were ever published. Her most widely read piece is a poem titled "Betrayal" that appeared in Harper's Monthly. Cautley Died July 6th, 1937. She was 83.
