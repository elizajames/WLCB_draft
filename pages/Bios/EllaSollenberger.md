## Ella Morrow Sollenberger (Mrs. Lawrence Randall) (1876-1951)

Almost all of Ella Morrow Sollenberger’s poems can be found in her publication of poems titled Driftwood and Other Verse, which was published in the 1930s. Originally from Newville PA, she moved to Baltimore with her husband Lawrence. Her love for presenting her poems at the Woman’s Literary Club meetings can be seen in the programs of the meetings that were printed in the Baltimore Sun, where her name was frequently listed alongside those of Lucy Meacham Thruston, Emily Paret Atwater, and Mrs. Walter Thomas. Sollenberger’s two most well-known poems are “Heritage” and “Knitting.” “Knitting”, a reflective poem about the experience of mothers on the homefront, spread like wildfire, appearing in many publications including, most impressively, the New York Times. Having raised two boys, her love for family and feelings towards war can be seen in many of the poems appearing in Driftwood and Other Verse.
