    <p class="card-text">The Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore Archive documents the words and lives of a fascinating group of women. They sought lasting fame in print, but have been all but forgotten. This archive is an attempt to remedy that.</p>
    <p class="card-text">The Women's Literary Club of Baltimore was not a book club. These women were writers, and determined to see their works in print. Established in 1890 by two single women, Hester Crawford Dorsey and Louisa Haughton, throughout the fifty years of its existence, the Club provided a place for over 300 women who aspired to become writers, poets, composers, and playwrights to share their work and their dreams. Their motto, "Parole Femine," the second half of the Maryland state motto "Fatti maschii, parole femine" ("Manly deeds, womanly words"), proudly asserted their identity as women, as writers, and as Marylanders. So far, we have located over 1000 published works by Club members.</p>
      <p class="card-text">The Club accommodated members who ranged across the social and political spectrum, including suffragettes and society wives, teachers and journalists, Confederate sympathizers and descendants of abolitionists, Protestants and Catholics. No Black women, however, were admitted.</p>
      <p class="card-text">This site includes biographies, Club records, links to published works, and online exhibits. All data is available to download and additional resources are available on this site to promote future scholarship.</p>
